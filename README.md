# Memory Game

The memory game built in JavaScript is an engaging and interactive web-based game where players are challenged to match pairs of cards from a shuffled deck. The game starts with all cards face down, and players reveal two cards at a time by clicking on them. If the revealed cards match, they stay face up; if not, they flip back over, allowing players to remember their positions. The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging event listeners for card clicks and using logic to track matches, moves, and game completion. JavaScript's dynamic nature allows for a smooth and responsive gaming experience, with animations and effects enhancing user interaction.
